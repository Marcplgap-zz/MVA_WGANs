    "One of the main characteristics of the Wasserstein GAN is that the **Critic** (the equivalent of the Discriminator for GAN in the original paper of Goodfellow et al.) is allowed to have a range of real values instead of assigning a binary class (fake or real) to the sampled image. However, to facilitate convergence, this indicator must be bound to a small value. The authors of WGAN define it at the $w \\in \\{-0.01,0.01\\}$ range, but given the difference in complexity due to the fingerprint patterns, we decide for a more strict constraint (see Kernel [4]). In any case, we prepare the wasserstein loss function that the neural networks are going to use as the metric for minimizing their error. Given that `y_true` will be binary with value -1 for an image coming from the real sample and 1 for a value coming from the generator, this will set up a proper basis for the critic to minimize unto."

    "Defining the critic model. To disect a bit the different components within it:\n",

    "* `in_shape(x,y,z)` is referencing the **input shape** that the critic will accept. The $(x,y)$ pair refers to the pixels of a $x\\times y$ image, while $z$ is left to the channel, which in our case is 1 as we simply use greyscaled images but it could be 3 in case that all three primary chromatic sources are deployed.\n",
    "* The weight initialization parameter `init` corresponds to the **prior** $p(z)$ and is needed to generate the stochastic component of the model. WGAN authors recommend using either a uniform or a gaussian distribution, which is what we decide for in here.\n",
    "* We define the **constraints for the weights** as discussed in kernel [3] above.\n",
    "* `LeakyReLU` allows for a small gradient when a specific link between layers should not be active. The slope is controlled by the hyperparameter `alpha`, and should in general be kept small.\n",
    "* The `Sequential` class allows the pipeline between layers. Later on we will also use it to merge the Critic and the Generator parts of the GAN. We use two hidden layers before encoding the outcome into a single value, the critic \"score\" defining how real an image looks.\n",
    "* For details on `Conv2D`, visit the keras documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D. The 4x4 convolutional window has been chosen based on standard practise. \n",
    "* **Batch normalization** is applied at every layer to re-standarize the outcomes from the previous layer and ensure proper performance. Spectral normalization (see the report) could also be considered.\n",
    "* The activation step (from the last hidden layer to the output) requires of a **linear function** to assign the critic score. This is the default for `Dense(1)`. However, we need to pass an array to the activation layer, so `Flatten()` is used to convert the previous output tensor to the correct shape.\n",
    "* The WGAN paper mentions that the model is unstable under momentum based optimizers, and instead decides to deploy `RMSProp`, so we follow their lead on this decision. The learning rate is set to a small value to ensure convergence, the other main potential issue that the authors discuss on that regard.\n",
